[[https://melpa.org/#/markdown-ts-mode][file:https://melpa.org/packages/markdown-ts-mode-badge.svg]]

A major mode for Emacs providing really BASIC syntax highlight for
markdown files using Treesitter.

Please note this provides very basic functionality. If you're looking
for a fully featured mature mode, please consider [[https://jblevins.org/projects/markdown-mode/][markdown-mode]].


** Install

This package is available on MELPA. If you already have it set, add to your ~init.el~ file:

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
  (use-package markdown-ts-mode
    :mode ("\\.md\\'" . markdown-ts-mode)
    :defer 't
    :config
    (add-to-list 'treesit-language-source-alist '(markdown "https://github.com/tree-sitter-grammars/tree-sitter-markdown" "split_parser" "tree-sitter-markdown/src"))
    (add-to-list 'treesit-language-source-alist '(markdown-inline "https://github.com/tree-sitter-grammars/tree-sitter-markdown" "split_parser" "tree-sitter-markdown-inline/src")))
#+END_SRC


Alternatively, download the ~markdown-ts-mode.el~ file to a directory
of your liking. And add to your ~init.el~ file the path:

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
  (add-to-list 'load-path "~/you_liked_dir/")

  (use-package markdown-ts-mode
    :mode ("\\.md\\'" . markdown-ts-mode)
    :defer 't
    :config
    (add-to-list 'treesit-language-source-alist '(markdown "https://github.com/tree-sitter-grammars/tree-sitter-markdown" "split_parser" "tree-sitter-markdown/src"))
    (add-to-list 'treesit-language-source-alist '(markdown-inline "https://github.com/tree-sitter-grammars/tree-sitter-markdown" "split_parser" "tree-sitter-markdown-inline/src")))
#+END_SRC

** Don't skip this
Before using it, be sure you have BOTH ~markdown~ and ~markdown-inline~ grammars installed.

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
  M-x treesit-install-language-grammar RET markdown RET
  M-x treesit-install-language-grammar RET markdown-inline RET
#+END_SRC

** FAQ
**** Why not use the "main" branch of tree-sitter-grammars repository?
Visit the tree-sitter-grammars repository, you'll get redirected to
the ~split_parser~ branch, since this is the default branch nowadays.

If you visit the ~main~ branch, there's a note communicating it is not
used anymore on the ~README.md~ file.

**** Why do I have to install TWO grammars?
Not my fault. The developers of tree-sitter-markdown decided so some
years ago there would be 2 parsers, one to the "body" part of
documents and one for "inline" statements.

So if you're only seeing part of your markdown files highlighted, one
of the grammars might be missing.


** Usage

Visit a markdown file. Turn on the mode with ~markdown-ts-mode~.

Navigate trough headings with ~imenu~.
